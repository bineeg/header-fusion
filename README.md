<h1>Header Fusion</h1>
<p><strong>Header Fusion</strong> is a Burp Suite extension designed to automate fuzzing of permuted combinations of predefined access control headers. Manually swapping headers between User A and User B can be tedious and time-consuming, but our extension automates the process by generating all possible header combinations. The results are displayed in the Burp Suite logger, where you can easily filter to view those generated by our extension.</p>

<p>To use the extension, log into the application with two different accounts (e.g., User A and User B). Collect the relevant access control headers (e.g., <code>X-Header-Name: Value</code>) and configure them in the UI . Then, send the request to the extension to automate the header swapping.</p>
